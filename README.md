# Smartthings Lambda Bridge
A node package that wraps the SmartThings Cloud API to use with AWS Lambda
I did borrow some insight from https://github.com/derekpovah/aws-lambda-st-iot-button

Also should you be intrested and making this code auto publish I came across this baby: https://blog.enki.com/using-git-on-aws-lambda-f365a2db706b

Also the structure of the code is very similar to the offical Smart things Repo (https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/smartapp-sdk-nodejs) but I hope its more flexable.
